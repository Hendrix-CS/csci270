# Files for Analysis

In this class we will be analyzing various expressions of the human
condition through language, art, and music. To assist us and make our
work personally valuable, you will be gathering text, images, and sound
files for the class to analyze in subsequent labs.

## Poem

First, it will be useful to have a small dataset for exploring our
algorithms and generating examples.

Find a small poem or lyrics to a song written in English that holds
meaning for you.

Save your poem as a plain text document with a short, meaningful file
name. (with file extension `.txt`) Your file size for this poem should
be no more than 20KB, and be saved using UTF-8 encoding.

## Book

To find statistical patterns in text data, we need a large amount of text.

Find a book/novel/treatise/creative work of fiction that has meaning to you, stored in an
electronic format. You should either find the novel available without
cost, or purchase the ebook (look for versions without DRM so we can
access the raw data). I **strongly recommend** using 
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to find a suitable book.
It contains many classic novels in plain text format.

Save your book as a plain text document with a short, meaningful file
name. (with file extension `.txt`) Your file size for this document
should be no less than 150KB, and be saved using UTF-8 encoding.

If your book is in another file format, such as `.epub`, it must be converted
to a plain text document. [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download)
can assist with this conversion.

## Image

Find an image of art stored in an electronic file format (PNG, JPEG,
TIFF, BMP, SVG, etc) that has meaning to you. This file must be at least HD
quality (1920 x 1080 pixels in size).

## Instrumental Music

Find a piece of instrumental music (no singing) stored in the `.mp3`
file format that has meaning to you.

## Reflection

For each of your selections, answer the following questions:

-   What makes this selection interesting to you?
-   What do you estimate is the reading level for this text? (only
    answer for Poem and Book)
-   Would you say this selection conveys an overall positive or negative
    sentiment?
-   Formulate a research question you hope to answer by analyzing this
    selection computationally.
	
Submit your answers to these reflection questions through the `Creating a Corpus` quiz in Teams.

# What to Hand In

Upload each of your four files to the appropriate directory under the `Files` tab in Teams.
