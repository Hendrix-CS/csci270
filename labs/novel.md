## Materials

* For this week's lab, download and install the latest version of [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/).

## Overview

Our goal in this lab is to create a [visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel), 
a creative work that integrates text, music, and images. 

As the term "novel" suggests, a visual novel tells a story primarily by means of text, with images 
and music as supplemental story elements.  The reader of the visual novel typically has opportunities
to make choices that determine the story outcome.

You may develop your visual novel on your own, or you are welcome to work as part of a team of up to 
three people producing a single visual novel.

The content of the visual novel should be "family-friendly".

## Design Document

Before you begin programming, write a design document consisting of the following:
* A one-paragraph overview of the novel, describing the protagonist, the protagonist's goals, and 
  the general themes of the novel.
* A description of every possible ending of the novel. There should be at least one ending where the
  protagonist succeeds and a different ending where the protagonist fails.
* A listing and brief description of each character in the novel. There should be at least two
  distinct characters in addition to the protagonist.
* A description of each anticipated decision point in the novel. It should have at least five distinct
  decision points, and there should be at least one ending which is reached by making at least two 
  distinct decisions.

## Images and Music

The story should be enhanced with images and music as follows:
* Each character should have at least one image.
  * You may have more than one image per character if you wish to reflect different moods.
* The story should have at least two background images reflecting different scenes.
* There should be at least three musical loops to accompany scenes from the novel. Each musical loop
  should somehow enhance or reinforce the general mood of the scenes it accompanies.
* It is perfectly fine for images and musical loops to be used in more than one scene.

## To Submit via Teams
