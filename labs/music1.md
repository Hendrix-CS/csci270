## Materials

For this week's lab:

* Download and install the latest version of [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net).
* Make a copy of the [CSCI 270 Music Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrielferrer/csci-270-music-visualization) notebook in your Kaggle account.

## Overview

Our goal in this lab is to learn how to algorithmically create aesthetically pleasing music. By using 
[Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net), we can write programs that generate music. By visualizing existig music, we can try to understand how it is put together,
thus giving us some insight into how to create our own compositions.

## Visualizing Music

Use the [CSCI 270 Music Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrielferrer/csci-270-music-visualization) notebook to visualize the note distribution of 
your selected instrumental work. (You should have access to the `CSCI 270 Music 2022` data set. Add it
to your copy of the notebook.) Then answer the following questions:

1. What are the most commonly occurring notes?

2. What are some groups of notes that commonly occur together?

## Sonic Pi, Part 1

Write a Sonic Pi program inspired by an aspect of your instrumental piece. Use some of the
notes you identified in the previous part. It need not replicate that aspect, but it should
be in some way related to it. The music produced should be 10-20 seconds in duration.

## Visualizing Additional Music

Again using the [CSCI 270 Music Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrielferrer/csci-270-music-visualization) notebook,
visualize two additional pieces of instrumental music.

For each piece, answer the following questions:

1. What are the most commonly occurring notes?

2. What are some groups of notes that commonly occur together?

3. How is the pattern of note usage similar to or different from your selected piece of music?

## Sonic Pi, Part 2

Write a Sonic Pi program that takes inspiration from two distinct aspects of your piece and 
at least one aspect of the other two selected pieces. The music produced should be 40-80 seconds
in duration. It should also employ at least three distinct synthesizer sounds.

## To Submit
* Answers to the questions above.
* Your two Sonic Pi programs.
