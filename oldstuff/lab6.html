<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>On a Mac</h3>
Open up the terminal and type
<p>
<pre>
conda env list
</pre>
<p>
Hopefully you only see the "root" environment. Then type
<p>
<pre>
source activate root
</pre>
<p>
to get the mappings correct for your programs. Now type
<p>
<pre>
python
</pre>
<p>
and you should get the Anaconda version 3.X. Here is what I see
<p>
<pre>
Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda 4.4.0 (x86_64)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:04:09)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
</pre>
<p>
Now in the python console, type
<p>
<pre>
import nltk
nltk.download()
</pre>
<p>
Use this GUI to find the "book" link in the "Collections" tab and download it. This
will load many datasets and libraries.
<p>
Also install the VADER library and collection.
<p>
Next, exit out of python, back to the terminal. Time to install more libraries.
<p>
<pre>
pip install afinn
pip install graphviz
pip install google-api-python-client
pip install google-cloud-language
</pre>
<p>
Finally, follow the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/quickstart-client-libraries">Quickstart Instructions</a>
to get the credentials and libraries installed for Google Cloud. Because we are accessing the
API through Python, you should not have to install the Cloud Tools.

<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
Analyze your selected poem using the Sentiment Analysis tools AFINN and VADER.  Discuss which
words have the largest effect on your overall sentiment score for the document.

<h3>Part of Speech Tagging</h3>
Train a Bigram Tagger (with a backup Unigram Tagger ( with a backup Default NN Tagger)) using 
the labeled Brown corpus of text.
<p>
Use this tagger to find the
part of speech for the bold words in the following sentences. How accurate are the taggings?
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, they haven't been paying on time <b> recently </b>.
<li>I'd like to thank you all <b> for </b> attending today's meeting.
<li>Art lovers can visit the <b> Metropolitan Museum of Art </b> on the Upper Eastside next to Central Park.
<li> <b> However </b>, there are a number of places and events that really must be seen and enjoyed if you are in London.
<li>To experience the famous <b> eccentric </b> side of British life, make sure to visit Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park
<li>Not only are London parks beautiful, <b> but </b> they may be one of the only places you can meet the British.
<li>They were able to choose from a limited number of programs on three or four <b> channels </b>.
<li>Another choice <b> might be </b> playing a video game on the computer or TV screen.
<li>Gone are the days when a worker might sit <b> around </b> the staff room discussing last night's entertainment.
<li>I <b> often </b> feel we've forgotten to communicate with our surroundings.
</ul>
<h3>Parsing</h3>

Pick two sentences from this collection of <a href="https://thejohnfox.com/long-sentences/">65 
Long Sentences in Literature</a>.
<p>
Use the Google Cloud API to parse these sentences and draw the resulting
parse-tree using the graphvix library for Digraphs.
<p>
<b>CHANGE FOR SENTENCE LENGTH</b>
<p>
For the following <a href="http://thecopybot.com/write-long-sentences/">sentence</a>:
<P>
<pre>
Gasper Hicks stared down at the dead teenager at the foot of his door and 
realized he knew him; knew him as a boy, from the days when Gasper taught 
Sunday school, knew him as a blonde, dirt-faced kid desperate for attention, 
knew him as one of the dozen anxious children they bussed from the trailer park.
</pre>
<p>
compare the parse trees generated by the 
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/">Stanford Parser</a> and 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/">Google Cloud Natural Language</a>.
What differences in structure and/or tagging do you find? Do you think
these differences are significant?
