## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, my goal is for you to be able to:

1. Understand methods for encoding and manipulating text, images, and sound.
1. Use computational tools to visualize and summarize information in text documents.
1. Calculate similarity metrics for documents in a corpus.
1. Cluster similar documents with hierarchical algorithms.
1. Learn topic models for documents and derive semantic closeness of words.
1. Generate and understand sequence information found in text.
1. Develop models for sentiment and structure analysis.
1. Employ computational methods for generating music and art.
1. Pursue independent explorations of advanced topics.

# <a name="readings">Readings</a>

We will be using no textbook but instead supplemental material such as relevant
web-pages for the course. Readings will be assigned before material will be
covered in class. You are expected to review the material and come to class
prepared. As readings are assigned, they will be posted here.

# Coursework

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish.
Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family
obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments
will receive at most half credit.

## <a name="labs">Labs</a>: 500 points

Much of your experience with the techniques of
computational humanities in this course will be through weekly labs.
Each lab will be assigned in class with some time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **in approximately one week**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

On these labs, you can work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, both students must use a late day.

## <a name="projects">Project</a>: 210 points

| #  | Name | Points | Assigned | Due |
|:--:|-----||:------:|:--------:|:---:|
|1 | [Final Project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/sample-project.html)  | 210  | Mar 19 | Apr 6 |

You will have a final project in this course.
Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each
project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>: 250 points

| #  | Topics | Points | Date |
|:--:|-----||:------:|:----:|
|1 | text encoding, data processing, fonts, word clouds, and clustering | 100 | Feb 18 |
|2 | stemming, lemmatizing, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, POS tagging, and Markov models | 150 | Mar 17 |

There will be two in-class exams, the first worth 100 and the
second worth 150 points of your final grade.
They will consist of short answer questions along with writing and debugging code.
There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as described above under Projects.

## <a name="checkins">Checkins and Participation</a>: 40 points

Two times throughout the semester, you are expected to
make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. Each checkin
meeting will count for 20 points.
This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding.
These should be scheduled during the weeks shown
on the [course calendar](https://app.teamgantt.com/public/projects/calendar/2020-01-12?ids=1990087&projectIds=1990087&publicKeys=eh0JCy4TSjrP&userResourceIds=0).
