## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, my goal is for you to be able to:
* Computationally analyze digital creative works comprised of text, images, and sound.
* Combine quantitative and qualitative analysis of a digital creative work.
* Visualize and summarize textual, musical, and visual information.
* Measure and visualize similarity of digital creative works.
* Employ algorithmic structures to synthesize original digital creative works.

## <a name="finalproject">Final Project</a>

The [final project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project.html) for this course may take one of two forms:
1. You may apply a computational humanities tool to a dataset of your choice. 
2. You may create an original creative digital work. It may involve any combination of text, images, and music
that you wish. The creative work must have an algorithmic aspect at its core. 

Either form of project will require submitting the following:
* A project proposal.
* An oral presentation in the final exam period for the course.
* A paper, either analyzing your results or reflecting upon your creative work.
* All code used in creating the project, sufficient to digitally reproduce your work.

## Tokens

Each student begins the semester with **six tokens**. 
* Send Dr. Ferrer a message on Teams to spend a token.
* Students may **spend** tokens as follows:
  * Spend **one** token to submit a revised version of an assignment, in the event the assignment is not Complete.
  * Spend **two** tokens to request an extension on an assignment deadline. 
    * When requesting an extension, specify the new deadline that you think will suffice.
    * Most deadline requests will be approved, but the instructor reserves the right to limit extensions if he deems them unreasonable.
  * Spend **three** tokens to submit an assignment after its deadline (including extended deadlines).
* To earn additional tokens:
  * Earn **one** token by booking and attending an office hours appointment. 
    * A student may earn up to **one token per week** from attending office hours, and a maximum of **six** tokens over the course of 
      the semester.
  * Earn **four** tokens by creating a 2-4 minute video educating a viewer about a concept from the course.
* Students may not go into token debt - to spend tokens, a student must have a positive balance.
