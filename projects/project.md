## Description

The final project for this course may take one of two forms:
1. You may apply a computational humanities tool to a dataset of your choice. 
2. You may create an original creative digital work. It may involve any combination of text, images, and music
that you wish. The creative work must have an algorithmic aspect at its core. 

Either form of project will require submitting the following:
* A project proposal.
* An oral presentation in the final exam period for the course.
* A paper, either analyzing your results or reflecting upon your creative work.
* All code used in creating the project, sufficient to digitally reproduce your work.

### Sample Project Topics

<!--
## Proposal: 30 points

The first step in your project is developing a proposal. This two-page
document will be due at the beginning of class on April 9th. There are
three required sections of your proposal.

### Research Question 13

Most importantly, you must clearly state a research question you wish to
address through your project. Introduce your topic and its relevance to
the course material.

### Data Set 13

Every project must involve the analysis of data. Identify the corpus of
data you will be using for your analysis. Who gathered and organized
this data? How large is the data (number of individual
files/documents/images, total file size?)

### References 6

Include references to sources you will use to inform your analysis.

## Presentation: 60 points

You will give a 10 minute in-class presentation. Time and
material should be split evenly between all project partners.
Leave at least one (1) minute
for questions at the end of your presentation.

Practice is strongly encouraged prior to your actual presentation. The
best way to be comfortable with presenting in front of an audience is to
practice. You will be graded on both the organization and the
presentation of your talk. The 10 minute time-limit will be strictly
enforced to ensure equal time for all presentations.

Your objective in the presentation is to fill us in on the main ideas of how
you approached and analyzed your topic, following this outline for your talk.

-   Introduction
-   Data
-   Algorithm
-   Analysis
-   Future Work
-   References

You should clearly explain the research question, your selected dataset,
and the supporting references you used.

Be sure to describe the algorithmic details involved in your work. Is your
approach to answer your question rule-based, probabilistic, or a mixture
of the two? Does it involve machine learning algorithms? How is your
data represented and processed?

Also, you should include at least one graph/image/sound-file of results based on
your research. Clearly identify your axes, use colors and
labels to quickly convey your information.

## Summary Paper: 70 points

Your paper must be at least 6 pages. Your paper should be readable by a
layperson who is not familiar with your tools and algorithms but has a
basic understanding of computer science; essentially, write the paper
for yourself before you took this class, based on the prereqs of CSCI
150: Foundation of CSCI. You should include the following sections

-   Introduction
-   Data
-   Algorithm
-   Analysis
-   Future Work
-   References

Be sure to make good use of figures and graphs to demonstrate your
results, use proper grammar and spelling, and use proper citations.

## Data and Implementation: 50 points

Finally include any code and IPython documents along with your dataset.
Your notebook should be well-organized including headers and Markdown
blocks to denote the different sections of your analysis.
